# Games PushdownSpaceX

## PushdownSpaceX

In this game you earn points with the use of a Stack, where every time you make a "pop" you get points. 
In the game you face enemy UFOs that when killerd will trigger a push on the stack, and to empty it you 
need to gather a Lambda that can be found on the board. You will lose points when you make a pop an the 
stack is empty, or when you make a push and you've already reached the stacks limit. The complexity of 
the Stack is (n) , since it dependes on the players actions and the stack cannot be filled with more 
than 6 elements it will be executed n times by the player.
